  - I resumed my work on installing =operating system=. This time I tried to
    install Windows OS and on top of it I installed Ubuntu Machine.
  - After successful installation of both OS's. I restarted my machine to check
    whether grub entries are there or not.
  - I couldn't see the grub entries for Windows OS. Then I logged into the
    Ubuntu machine and updated the grub using command "grub-update".
  - Then I could see both OS's grub entries.
