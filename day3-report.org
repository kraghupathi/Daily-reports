** From 9:30 AM TO 05:30 PM :
 - I have completed Regular Expressions concepts and took video lecture at [[http://sbarjatiya.com/website/video_tutorials/regular_expressions.ogv][www.sbarjatiya.com]] and done the assignments as well. Through which I came to learn the following commands
+ *  (The preceding item will be matched zero or more times)

2. rm -f *.txt (which is used to remove files from ending with extension txt)
#+end_example

+ ?  (The preceding item is optional and will be matched at one time)
#+begin_example
rm -f file? (which is used to remove files with only one charecter or number)
#+end_example
+ ??  (The preceding item is optional and will be matched at two times)
#+begin_example
rm -f file?? (which is used to remove files with only two charecters or numbers)
#+end_example
+ [a-b] or [A-Z] (The preceding item is matched exactly from a-z or A-Z)
#+begin_example
rm -f (a-z)/(A-Z) (which is used to remove alphabeticals in a directories)
#+end_example
+ [0-9] (The preceding item is matched exactly from 0-9)
#+begin_example
rm -f [0-9] (which is used to remove digits in a directories)
#+end_example

* grep command:
+ - grep is a command which is used to search a word or number in a files
#+begin_example
Syntax:-grep <OPTIONS> <PATTERN> <FILES>
grep ^a filename (^ means start with line of a in file)
grep a$ filename ($ means end with line in file )
grep '[[:alpha:]]\>' * filename (which is used to alphabets ending of a line)
grep '\<[[:alpha:]]' * filename (which is used to alphabets begining of a line)
grep '[[:digit:]]\>' * filename (which is used to numbers ending of a line)
grep '\<[[:digit:]]' * filename (which is used to numbers  begining of a line)
#+end_example

* sed command:
 - sed is a command which is used to inline edit the file
 
#+begin_example
Syntax:-sed <OPTIONS> <SCRIPT> <INPUTFILE>

sed -e 's/ornge*/orange/g' filename (* it indicates the all the charecters edit at once)
#+end_example
