* 2016-Feb-02-Wednesday
** From 9:30 AM TO 12:30 PM :
 - I started taking online course on File Permissions. And completed 2
    video lectures and done the assignment as well. Through which I came to learn following commands

* File Permissions:   
 - Permissions are access to rights to users and groups of users.Every file or directory in linux has 3 permssions defined as owners, those are

   * Owner  - a single person who owns the file.
   * Group  - every file belongs to a single group.
   * Others - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner.

 - Read = 4
 - Write = 2
 - Execute = 1

#+begin_example
Syntax:- chmod <options> <mode> <files>
chmod 777 file
#+end_example 

#+begin_example
chmod -R 777 file
#+end_example 

** From 2:00 PM TO 6:00 PM :  
 - I started taking online course from [[www.sbarjatiya.com]] on ssh, scp and rsync Commands. And completed
    video lectures and done the assignment as well. Through which I came to learn following commands

* SSH (Secure Shell):
 - SSH is a Network protocol which is used for secure communication.
 - The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol by default uses port 22.

#+begin_example
Syntax:- ssh <username>@<hostname>
#+end_example 

* SCP (Secure Copy):
 - SCP is a secure copy from between hosts on a network.

#+begin_example
Syntax:- scp [options] <username>@<hostname>:<sourcepath> <destination> (copy from remote machine to local machine)
Syntax:- scp [options] <source:path> <username>@<hostname>:<destination> (copy from local machine to remote machine)
#+end_example

* rsync (Remote Synchronized):
 - rsync is a remote synchronized command, which is used for copying files and directories remotely as well as locally in Linux/Unix systems.
#+begin_example
Syntax:- rsync [options] user@host:sourcepath destination:path (copy from remote machine to local machine)
Syntax:- rsync [options] source:path user@host:destination:path (copy from local machine to remote machine)
#+end_example

* Difference between SCP and RSYNC:
 - Itâ€™s faster than scp (Secure Copy) because rsync uses remote-update protocol which allows to transfer.
 - Difference between two files in a directory, it copies the two files from source to destination, but next time,
   it copies only the changed files to the desination
